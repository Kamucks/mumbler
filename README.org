Mumbler is a lisp programming language I wrote to try out the [[http://openjdk.java.net/projects/graal/][Graal JIT]] for the JVM.

* Mumbler
Mumbler is a very small lisp modeled after Scheme but with far fewer special forms and built-in functions. Here is the "[[http://cesquivias.github.io/blog/2014/10/13/writing-a-language-in-truffle-part-1-a-simple-slow-interpreter/#mumbler-language][Mumbler language specification]]".

* Build
Mumbler uses [[http://gradle.org/][Gradle]] as the build system. To build the code simply run

#+begin_src shell-script
    cd ${MUMBLER_REPO}/lang
    ./gradlew installDist
#+end_src

* Run
Mumbler requires a special version of the JVM. You can download a [[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oracle-labs/program-languages/downloads/index.html][graal JVM]] from Oracle. Mumbler requires version 0.14 or greater.

You can start Mumbler's REPL from the build directory. Just set ~JAVA_HOME~ to point to the Graal JVM.

#+begin_src shell-script
    JAVA_HOME=<graal-vm-dir> ${MUMBLER_REPO}/lang/build/install/mumbler/bin/mumbler
#+end_src

** Run tests
The test/ directory contains several Mumbler scripts that try out different features. To run all the tests:

#+begin_src shell-script
    ${MUMBLER_REPO}/test/run_tests
#+end_src

You can try out individual scripts by starting running Mumbler directly.

#+begin_src shell-script
  ${MUMBLER_REPO}/lang/build/install/mumbler/bin/mumbler ${MUMBLER_REPO}/test/<a-random-script>.mumbler
#+end_src

** Run benchmarks
[[sec:build][Build]] Truffle and Mumbler and [[sec:env-var][set environment variables]].

#+begin_src shell-script
    ${MUMBLER_REPO}/benchmark/measure <benchmark-name>
#+end_src

~benchmark-name~ is the name of one of the directories under ~benchmark~.

** Set Environment Variables
Mumbler's scripts use two environment variables.

#+begin_example
    JAVA_HOME : The directory of the Graal VM. Mumbler may run using the default Oracle or OpenJDK JVM, but you won't see the performance gains that Graal provides.
    MUMBLER_HOME : The path where gradle built and installed Mumbler. It should be under ${MUMBLER_HOME}/lang/build/install/mumbler
#+end_example

The ~MUMBLER_REPO~ environment variable referenced here is not used by an scripts. It signifies where the Mumbler repo was cloned on your system.
